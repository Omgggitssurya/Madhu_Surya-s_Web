        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>As I sit down to write this letter, my heart is overflowing with love and gratitude for you. It feels like just yesterday when I first saw your Instagram request. From that moment, I knew there was something incredibly special about you. Even though I initially ghosted you, influenced by Pranavi, I quickly realized that staying away from you was impossible. My heart ached for you, and I knew I had to find my way back to you.

I've made my share of mistakes, disappointed you, and even made you angry. But through it all, my love for you has only grown stronger. I am ready to do anything to make you happy because you mean the world to me. When I proposed to you, asking, "Will you let me be your hero?" and you said yes, it was the happiest moment of my life. Your acceptance filled my heart with joy and hope.

You call me "kanna" and "my man," and every time you do, it makes me feel incredibly special. The way I feel after our kisses is unmatched, and just a single glance from you makes my heart race. Despite the challenges we've faced, including the disapproval from my family, I never gave up on us. I missed you every single moment we were apart last month, and it only made me realize how much I need you in my life.

Before I met you, I was a guy who feared talking to people. But today, because of you, I am able to socialize like never before. You have improved every aspect of my life, sweetie. Your love and support have given me the confidence to be the best version of myself.

I want to tell you that you are my girl, my queen, my everything. You have brought so much joy and love into my life, and I am eternally grateful for you. I truly believe we are meant to be, and I am ready to face any challenge as long as I have you by my side.

So, my love, can I be your hero?

Forever and always,
Surya</p>
